Before submitting this file, make sure that there are no more TODO
values left in the file (besides the one in this introduction of course).

Warmup and Debugging Exercise
-----------------------------
Q1: How do the values of the member variables of `allBalls[0]` change from iteration to iteration? Specifically, what happens to the values of `id`, `x`, and `y`?
A1: id does not change. x and y are scaled by a random integer

Q2: What is the pattern to how the values of the member variables of the stuck ball change from iteration to iteration?
A2: I tried 12 times to get the conditional debugger to work without success. Also, something's wrong such that every restart takes ~50 seconds to load.
I manually ran through all 24 nodes and found that the stuck balls keep the same vx and the vy variable just flips between positive and negative.

* Also: Is there not a way to set a random seed?? It's taking >15 runs to get a test case I can work with

Q3: After placing the stuck ball at (0, 0), does it move normally from there or does it stay stuck?
A3: It moves normally

Q4: On your system, what is the observed consequence of each of the three errors?
A4: SIGSEGV, executes normally, SIGABORT


Sorted Array Priority Queue
---------------------------
Q5: Give the results from your time trials and explain how is supports your Big O prediction for enqueue and dequeue.
A5: Stress test: 1.308 secs, Time trial: 1.466 secs, emptyQueue: 0 secs. This supports the idea that dequeueing happens
in constant time and enqueueing scales proportional to n (although in the average case, because of the special checks for
empty queues and last-position insertion, it's not always that bad).

Q6: If the PQSortedArray stored the elements in order of lowest-to-highest priority value instead of highest-to-lowest, what impact would this have on the Big O runtimes of enqueue and dequeue?
A6: TODO

Priority Queue Client Usage
---------------------------
Q7: Given the runtime of PQSortedArray enqueue/dequeue, what will be the runtime of pqSort? Run some timing trials to confirm your prediction, and include the data you collected in your final answer.
A7: TODO


Q8: Given the runtime of PQSortedArray enqueue/dequeue, what will be the runtime of topK? Run some timing trials to confirm your prediction, and include the data you collected in your final answer.
A8: TODO

Heap Priority Queue
-------------------
Q9: Draw the binary heap formed by inserting the specified nine DataPoints into an empty binary heap. Specifically, insert those data points in the other that's shown below. You only need to show your final answer, not your intermediate steps. Yes, we know that we're asking you to draw pictures in a text file (so here's a useful tool for "drawing" the binary heaps: http://asciiflow.com/).
A9: TODO

Q10: Draw the binary heap that results after two calls to the `dequeue` operation on the heap you drew in Q9.
A10: TODO

Q11: Draw the array representation of the binary heap that you drew in Q10.
A11: TODO


Q12: Run timing trials and provide your results that confirm that pqSort runs in time O(NlogN) and topK in O(NlogK).
A12: TODO
